		<p class="introduction">Hi there, I am the creater of this website. I am Currently a Master of Science student at Columbia University in Electrical Engineering. I earned B.S. in Physics at UCSB. I am joining Amazon as an SDE Intern for the summer of 2023. I am currently looking for full time SDE or SWE position.<br>
        I will take CS or data-related courses at Columbia. In my spare time, I am focusing on using python and MySQL to solve real-world problems (e.g.My personal project of a used car analyzer web application). I have many fabulous course project. However, I could not show some of them because of copyright issue.<br>
    	As you can see I majored in Physics in my undergraduate study. I do believe this is what makes me unique. I have a strong mathematical foundation. I could not only think as an engineer but also as a physicist (e.g.BFS feels like water flow to me, more explicitly filling up a water pipe network). With all of the algorism and technology I am learning and have learned so far, I could create amazing products at your company.</p>
